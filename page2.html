        <h1>Tsar Ivan's Reign</h1>
            <h3>"Terrible" means "Dread" or "Awesome"</h3>
            <p>Let's start with his traditional title, Грозный ("grozny"), translated as "Terrible." But
                this is an example of an archaic nickname changing connotations over time. In the 16th 
                century, this name meant "Awesome," "Strong," or even "Menacing-to-his-enemies." It was a
                typical royal epithet, meant to describe his physical prowess (he was an enormous man and
                very athletic) as well as his effectiveness as a military leader.
            </p>
            <p>Under Tsar Ivan the Terrible's reign, the Russian State expanded tripled in size, thanks,
                in no small part, to the political and military leadership of the Tsar. He reformed local
                government, preserving both monarchical principles accepted at that time, as well as 
                democratic ones. His "zemstvo" reforms provided for direct elections of local office-holders.
            </p>
            <p>The Tsar was not content to give his subjects local control over their authorities, however. 
                He also instituted a form of free primary public education, accessible to everyone. He also 
                opened the first printing press in Russia, and published a ten-volume national history. 
            </p>
            <p><i>But what of the deaths and tortures?</i> you may be wondering. How did he have the time for all of
                these progressive projects for social betterment when he was so busy coaxing coerced confessions
                out of nobles unfortunate enough to have look at him the wrong way? 
            </p>
            <p>History is an inexact science. We rely upon witness testimony and physical evidence when peering through
                the dark glass of time. The fact of the matter is that the overwhelming majority of the juicy gossip 
                about Tsar Ivan IV comes from his bitter enemy-- a general who betrayed the Tsar and changed loyalty to
                the Lithuanian kingdom. For this reason, many objective historians believe that these are complete fabrications.
            </p>
            <p> But this factor-- the obvious bias of the sole witness-- has been plain knowledge from the beginning. Why,
                then, has Western historiography continued to portray Ivan IV not simply as "Terrible", but "Horrible"? One
                distinct possibility is that longstanding Anglo-Russian geopolitical hostilies have skewed the historical
                scholarship writing in English. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24657750"></a><i>How We Know What We Know about Ivan the Terrible</i></a> is an excellent
                paper for more in-depth reflection on this historical personage.</p>
